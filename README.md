# VHeal

A data processing app that delivers to its users accurate information about ailments and diseases in and around their locality. The app's intent is to predict and minimise the impact of <b>epidemics</b> - a major natural disaster.

<b>Idea</b>:

Of all the many natural disasters that pose a threat to life and property, <i>epidemic outbreaks</i> are arguably the most dangerous - it is a true challenge to predict viruses and bacterial patterns in a city, that virtually spawn out of nowhere and wreak havoc.

Our project/ idea focuses on studying disease patterns and alerting potential victims about such outbreaks post a detailed analysis of the data collected first-hand.

<b>Methodology</b> (Abstract):

1. Common people and victims of any disease upload information about verified cases of ailments/ diseases, patient information through an app, preferably along with a report.

2. A credit score (like Azure credits or Flipkart money, say) is added to the user's account for every valid data entry - frequency and authenticity of data entered into the app by a particular user are monitored and thus data duplication and defrauding are avoided.

3. The collected data is flushed through back-end algorithms and necessary data is filtered out.

4. Every area (Pincode-wise) gets a detailed report on the number of cases reported, its Health index, on search request.

5. Every user can now search for the number of reported cases of selected or all diseases in any area around their locality (anywhere in the world too), before they decide to journey to that locality, thereby public awareness is guaranteed.

<b>Motivation</b>:

1. Every user's data entry is vital for the app to work effectively, and they serve a noble cause towards alerting the public about potential epidemic outbreaks.

2. Every honest user gets a credit score which they can make use of in e-commerce outlets, online stores, etc.

3. Every user is serviced with appropriate representation of diseases that are on the rise in their selected area of choice.
